                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>San Francisco’s dual identity as a global AI hub and a city grappling with housing unaffordability presents a critical paradox. Between 2017 and 2024, the AI sector’s expansion—42% of U.S. AI firms are based in the Bay Area—has coincided with volatile rent trends, and assumptions about direct causation (Global AI Market Report, 2023). This article analyzes the interplay between the AI-driven tech boom and housing costs, comparing pre-pandemic (2017–2019) and post-pandemic (2022–2024) periods, with the question of How historical housing data is impacted by the tech boom (e.g. rental prices, property values, availability). Key advancements, such as the 2017 transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), catalyzed corporate growth, yet inflation-adjusted rents in AI-heavy neighborhoods like Potrero Hill rose only moderately, while non-tech areas like zip codes 94111 and 94112 saw sharper increases (San Francisco Housing Authority, 2023). Historical precedents further complicate this relationship: the 2014–2015 tech boom spiked rents citywide, but subsequent layoffs and the COVID-19 pandemic (2019–2023) temporarily stabilized prices (Zuk et al., 2018; Urban Displacement Project, 2021). Using mixed-methods analysis—rent data, corporate leases, and employee interviews—this study reveals spatially uneven impacts, urging a reevaluation of how technological growth intersects with urban equity.
